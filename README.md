#Medieval Items Store API
Welcome to the repository of the Medieval Items Store API! This project was developed with the aim of creating an API to manage medieval items, such as custom-made swords, using TypeScript and Sequelize.

##Technologies Used
This project makes use of various technologies to ensure its efficient operation. Below are the key technologies used:

-Node.js: The JavaScript runtime platform that powers the server application.

-TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality.

-Express.js: A Node.js web framework that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs.

-Sequelize: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for Node.js that makes it easy to interact with SQL databases.

-JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for authentication on some API routes, providing security for operations.

=Mocha: A widely-used JavaScript test framework that can be used for testing the API's routes and services.

##Key Features
-JWT Authentication: Protects sensitive routes with JWT authentication to ensure that only authorized users have access to certain resources.

-CRUD Operations: The API supports Create, Read, and Update operations for information related to medieval items.
